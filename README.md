The Crypto Price App is a robust platform providing users with real-time price tracking and analysis of a wide array of cryptocurrencies. It operates based on the CoinGecko API, ensuring reliable and accurate data retrieval. On the homepage, users are presented with a list of trending cryptocurrencies which, upon selection, lead to a detailed page. This page showcases a graph of price fluctuations, the market cap rank, the current price in both USD and BTC, the 24-hour price change, as well as the highest and lowest values recorded in the last 24 hours. Although the data for some cryptocurrencies might not be available due to limitations of the free API, the app endeavors to provide comprehensive information for the majority of cryptocurrencies without any hitch.
